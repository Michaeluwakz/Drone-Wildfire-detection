# Drone Wildfire Detection

## Overview
The **Drone Wildfire Detection** system is an advanced AI-powered application designed to detect and monitor wildfires using drone technology. The system leverages computer vision and real-time data analysis to identify fire outbreaks and send alerts to emergency responders.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Detection**: Uses machine learning models to detect smoke and fire.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live drone feeds provide continuous surveillance of wildfire-prone areas.
- **Automated Alerts**: Sends notifications to authorities and emergency responders.
- **Geospatial Mapping**: Integrates GPS to pinpoint exact locations of detected wildfires.
- **Data Logging**: Stores and analyzes historical fire data for predictive analysis.
- **Weather Integration**: Monitors environmental conditions that impact fire spread.

## Technologies Used
- **Drone Hardware**: Equipped with high-resolution cameras and thermal sensors.
- **AI & Computer Vision**: TensorFlow, OpenCV for real-time fire detection.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python (Flask/Django for AI processing)
- **Frontend**: React.js for user interface and monitoring dashboard.
- **Database**: MongoDB/PostgreSQL for storing fire incident data.
- **Cloud Services**: AWS/GCP for scalable data processing and storage.
